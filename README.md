# algorithms
This is a repo I keep for showcasing different algorithms I have implemented for my algorithms class at school.

## pathfinder
uninformed
* this is a search algorithm that searches for a goal state in a text-based maze composed of X's and .'s, where X's represent 
an impassible wall and .'s are places where the algorithm is free to move
  * the algorithm is implemented using a search tree where cost of each move is uniform so cost is proportional to the depth
  of the tree
* this alogrithm is, as the name implies, completely uninformed about its environment. because of this it is rather dumb and
inefficient, it is simple and easy to understand however.
